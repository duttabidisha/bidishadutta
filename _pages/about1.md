# About Me
* I am a postdoctoral associate in the Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science [QuICS](https://quics.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland. [[Curriculum Vitae](https://atulmantri.github.io/cv/)] [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?hl=en&pli=1&user=Xnm7lvQAAAAJ)][[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=atul+mantri&searchtype=all&source=header)]
* My research interests lie in the field of quantum computation and quantum information. I have actively worked on the design of delegated quantum computing protocols and questions related to quantum foundations. 
* In particular, I am interested in the roles of interaction, randomness, security, and quantum correlations in various quantum information-theoretic tasks pertaining to the client-server setting.
