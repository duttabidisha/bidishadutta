**Abstract**: Blind quantum computation protocols allow a weak computational client to delegate a quantum computation to a powerful remove quantum server while preserving the privacy of the computation. To date, such protocols are only known for settings involving at least two quantum devices.construction of a blind quantum computing protocol with a completely classical client and single quantum delegated to a remote quantum computer.
