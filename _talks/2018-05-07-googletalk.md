*Host*: Vamsi Krishna Devabathini 

**Abstract**:  It is expected that quantum computers will enable breakthrough in fields of science and will allow users to solve important problems faster that seems intractable today. However, like today's supercomputers, it is likely that they will be in a limited number with big corporations around the world. Recently, a broad wave of ambitious industry-led research programmes by Google, IBM, Microsoft, Rigetti have started making small scale quantum computing possible over the internet. How will a user with no quantum resource interact with such a quantum computer securely? In this talk, I will present the progress that has been made in the field of secure quantum computing over the last 10 years. I will also discuss our recent approach towards the construction of a delegated quantum computing protocol with a completely classical client and a single quantum server.
