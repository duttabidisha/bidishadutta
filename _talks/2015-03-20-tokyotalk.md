**Abstract**:  Blind Quantum Computation (BQC) is a cryptographic task by which a client, Alice, prepares an input state, and an encoding for a computation and sends it to a server, Bob, who performs the computation, in such a way that neither the computation nor the input is revealed to Bob. I will discuss upper and lower bounds on the quantum communication necessary to perform BQC. I will analyse the scenarios for some different choices of the client's quantum capabilities. Finally, I will present a generalization of BQC protocol which requires exponentially less quantum communication when the client possess a bit more sophisticated device.
